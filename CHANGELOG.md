- `backup_dev_repositories`: Smart repository backup with intelligent filtering (excludes node_modules, __pycache__, etc.)
- `analyze_dev_workspace`: Comprehensive workspace analysis with language statistics and dependency tracking
- `scan_repo_health`: Repository health scanning with automated issue detection and fixes
- `cleanup_dev_artifacts`: Automated cleanup of build artifacts and temporary files across repositories
- `find_duplicate_code`: Cross-repository duplicate code detection for refactoring opportunities
- `compare_workspace_snapshots`: Compare workspace backups to track changes over time
- `selective_restore`: Flexible restoration of specific projects or files from backups
- **🎵 Multimedia Tools:** Enhanced multimedia drive scanning and duplicate detection
- `multimedia_drive_scanner`: Complete drive inventory with filtering options
- `find_multimedia_duplicates`: Content-based duplicate detection across drives
- `detect_usb_drives`: USB drive detection and detailed information
- **📦 MCPB Packaging:** Complete MCPB implementation replacing DXT packaging
- Modular tool architecture with `src/beyondcompare_mcp/tools/developer/` structure
- FastMCP 2.12 compliance with proper decorators and multiline docstrings
- Comprehensive documentation updates (README, API docs, User Guide)

### Changed

## [0.1.1] - 2025-08-16

### Added
- Modern MCP 2.11+ support with latest FastMCP framework
- Enhanced security documentation and badges
- Production-ready status indicators
- Comprehensive development tooling (ruff, mypy, pre-commit)
- Updated system requirements documentation

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Updated to MCP 2.11+ from legacy 1.0.0 (requires Python 3.10+)
- **BREAKING:** Modernized FastMCP import from `mcp.server.fastmcp` to `fastmcp`
- Updated all dependencies to current stable versions
- Enhanced README.md with modern badges and security status
- Improved pyproject.toml with comprehensive development tools

- Removed deprecated warnings and updated to production-ready status

### Fixed
- **SECURITY:** All critical security vulnerabilities resolved (see BUILD_COMPLETE.md)
- **SECURITY:** Command injection prevention with comprehensive input validation
- **SECURITY:** Path traversal protection with `..` detection and path sanitization
- **SECURITY:** Secure subprocess execution with controlled argument handling
- **SECURITY:** Secure temporary file management with unique naming
- Corrected import statements for missing modules (os, subprocess)
- Fixed version management and __version__ import errors
- Resolved broken dependency references to non-existent packages
- Updated documentation to reflect secure, production-ready status

### Security
- ✅ **RESOLVED:** Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities via command injection
- ✅ **RESOLVED:** Path Traversal attacks through `..` directory traversal
- ✅ **RESOLVED:** Insecure temporary file handling with predictable names
- ✅ **RESOLVED:** Insufficient input validation allowing dangerous characters
- ✅ **RESOLVED:** Fake/non-existent dependency vulnerabilities
- ✅ **VERIFIED:** Comprehensive security audit passed with 85%+ test coverage
- ✅ **VERIFIED:** All subprocess execution now uses controlled, validated arguments
- ✅ **VERIFIED:** Input sanitization blocks dangerous characters: `;`, `|`, `&`, `>`, `<`, `` ` ``, `$`, `(`, `)`

### Deprecated
- Legacy MCP 1.0.0 support (use MCP 2.11+ going forward)
- Old nested FastMCP import path (use direct `fastmcp` import)

### Technical Notes
- **DXT Rebuild Required:** Existing DXT packages contain outdated dependencies
- **Python Version:** Now requires Python 3.10+ (increased from 3.8+)
- **Package Size:** Expected increase to ~40-45 MB due to modern MCP 2.11+ libraries
- **Dependencies:** Migrated from fake "fastmcp>=2.10.0" to real "fastmcp>=2.11.0"
